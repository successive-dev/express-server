<h1>MERN STACK </h1>
<p>MERN stack stands for MongoDB, express, reactjs, and nodejs. It's basically a collection of frameworks with which one can create a complete web-based application. Backend services are provided by MongoDB, express, and nodejs and for front-end we use reactjs. </p>

<h3>MongoDB</h3>
<p>MongoDB is a database program. Classified as a No-sql database program. It stores data in a json format unlike relational databases where data is stored in tables. 
<h4>Some basic terminology used in MongoDB</h4>
<p><strong>Collection</strong></p>
<p>Collection is what tables are in relational databases. They are nothing but a collection of data. 
</p>
<p><strong>Document</strong></p>
<p>Document is similar to a row in relational databases.</p>

<h3>Express</h3>
<p>Express provides a minimal interface to build our applications. It provides us the tools that are required to build our app. It is flexible as there are numerous modules available on npm, which can be directly plugged into Express.</p>

<h3>React</h3>
<p>A front-end lib written in javascript by Facebook devs.</p>

<h3>Node</h3>
<p> Node is nothing but chrome v8 running on desktop and therefore executing javascript code on desktop. This then provided the ability to include javascript files in our project and javascript built-in async nature is also a add-on to make web apps in nodejs.
